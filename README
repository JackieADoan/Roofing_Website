The Website is created in the "index.php" file. This was done to easily work
with any information and file that was included. The Main Way this website
Functions is by dividing the functions of the website in html <div> collections.
In each of these the code either has a main menu, a Form, or PHP code.

The code was done with Harrison Hall at first but he had no work done and by the
time he dropped the class I did the project by myself.
